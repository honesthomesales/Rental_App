# Rent Periods & Late Fee Management Setup

This document explains how to set up the new Rent Periods & Late Fee Management functionality in your Rental App.

## Overview

The Rent Periods feature allows you to:
- Track individual rent periods for each tenant
- Apply and manage late fees
- Bulk waive late fees for multiple periods
- View detailed payment history

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the Migration

The required database table is created by running the migration file:

```sql
-- This file is located at: supabase/migrations/005_create_rent_periods_table.sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor or via the CLI
```

### 2. Table Structure

The `RENT_rent_periods` table includes:
- `tenant_id`: Links to the tenant
- `property_id`: Links to the property
- `lease_id`: Links to the lease (optional)
- `period_due_date`: When rent is due
- `rent_amount`: Amount due for this period
- `amount_paid`: Amount already paid
- `late_fees`: Late fees applied (can be waived)
- `status`: Payment status (paid/unpaid/partial)
- `days_late`: Number of days late

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Page

Navigate to **Rent Periods** in the main menu (it's been added to the navigation).

### 2. Current Functionality

- **View Tenants**: See all tenants with late payments
- **Sort by Priority**: Tenants are sorted by payment cadence (Weekly â†’ Bi-weekly â†’ Monthly)
- **Search & Filter**: Find specific tenants or properties

### 3. Late Fee Management (After Table Setup)

Once the `RENT_rent_periods` table is created:

- **Select Periods**: Use checkboxes to select individual rent periods
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple periods and waive late fees at once
